"""
Notes:
    This math is based on a 6-dof arm, however even though our arm is 5-dof it has the same configuration (ZYYXY) leading up to the wrist 
    Since the configuration is the same, the math should be valid, but there will be orientations that the end effector cannot be placed in
    ex: if the wrist has to rotate out of the (xz) plane and but also be parallel with the ground (xy) plane
    Regardless of orientation I *think* that the end effector will still be able to reach whatever position we set, it just may be rotated in that position
    If the gripper was for example a pin or cylinder, the tip would be in the right place and this problem would not be noticeable 
    I think this problem will only come into play when we want to orient the gripper to pick items up that exist outside of the (xz) plane, so it still a good starting point
